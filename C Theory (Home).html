            <p>1] INTRODUCTION TO C LANGUAGE :</p>
            <br>
            <p>1. C Language is a powerful and widely-used programming language created by Dennis Ritchie in 1972.</p>
            <p>2. It is known for its speed, efficiency, and portability.</p>
            <p>3. C is often called the "mother of all languages" as it influenced many modern languages like C++, Java, and Python.</p>

            <p>2] FEATURES OF C LANGUAGE :</p>
            <br>
            <p>1. Simple and Easy to Learn – Uses clear syntax and structured code.</p>
            <p>2. Fast and Efficient – Ideal for performance-heavy programs.</p>
            <p>3. Portability – C code can run on different platforms with minimal changes.</p>
            <p>4. Rich Library Support – Includes standard libraries for common tasks.</p>
            <p>5. Low-Level Features – Allows direct access to memory and hardware.</p>
            <p>6. Modular Programming – Uses functions to improve code organization.</p>
            <p>7. Dynamic Memory Management – Supports efficient memory handling.</p>

            <p>3] ARCHITECTURE OF C LANGUAGE :</p>
            <br>
            <p>The C language follows a structured process :</p>
            <br>
            <p>1. Editor: Writing the code (e.g., CodeBlocks, VS Code).</p>
            <p>2. Preprocessor: Handles commands starting with # (e.g., #include).</p>
            <p>3. Compiler: Translates code into machine language.</p>
            <p>4. Linker: Combines code files and libraries into an executable.</p>
            <p>5. Loader: Loads the executable into memory for execution.</p>
            <p>6. Execution: The program runs with the CPU performing tasks.</p>

            <p>4] BASIC STRUCTURE OF A C PROGRAM :</p>
            <br>
            <p>C program follows this format:</p>
            <pre style="font-family:initial;">
                #include <stdio.h>   		                     // Header file
                  int main() {        		            // Main function
                       printf("Hello , World!");      // Output statement
                       return 0;        		            // End of the program
                  } 
            </pre>
            <p>Explanation:</p>
            <p>1. #include <stdio.h> – Includes the standard input-output library.</p>
            <p>2. int main() – The starting point of every C program.</p>
            <p>3. printf() – Prints output on the screen.</p>
            <p>4. return 0; – Signals successful program completion.</p>

            <p>5] IMPORTANT CONCEPTS IN C LANGUAGE :</p>
            <br>
            <p>1. Data Types: Define the type of data (e.g., int, float, char).</p>
            <p>2. Variables: Store data values (e.g., int age = 25;).</p>
            <p>3. Operators: Perform operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), etc.</p>
            <p>4. Control Statements: Direct program flow (e.g., if, else, for, while).</p>
            <p>5. Functions: Reusable code blocks that improve program structure.</p>
            <p>6. Arrays: Store multiple values in a single variable.</p>
            <p>7. Pointers: Store memory addresses, essential for dynamic memory management.</p>
            <p>8. Structures: Group related data under one name for better organization.</p>
